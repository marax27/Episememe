# Episememe
A media (pictures, memes, videos, texts) repository

## *Project "on hold" until 2021*
*Episememe started as a small university project, and it has already reached a bare minimum of usability - you can upload, browse and tag media, the tag graph system also works. However, there's plenty more to do here ([project boards](https://github.com/marax27/Episememe/projects)), and hopefully the project will gain some traction in 2021 once we find some time between studying and working.*

## Getting started
Windows:
1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. `npm install -g @vue/cli`
3. Try out `vue --version` in Powershell. If there is an error related to execution policies, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` (as an administrator).
4. Go to `/vue-client` directory and install dependencies:
```
cd vue-client
npm install
```
5. In order to start an application, run `npm run serve`.

## Useful commands
See `vue-client/README.md`.

## Desktop mode
See `build/README-desktop-mode.md`.
